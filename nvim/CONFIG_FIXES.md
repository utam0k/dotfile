# Neovim Configuration Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Command in formatting.lua**
- **Issue**: The `FormatInfo` command was calling `require("conform").format()` instead of showing info
- **Fix**: Changed to `vim.cmd("ConformInfo")` to properly display formatter information

### 2. **Duplicate Keymaps**
- **Issue**: `[d` and `]d` keymaps were defined in both `config/keymaps.lua` and `plugins/linting-formatting-ui.lua`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate keymaps from `linting-formatting-ui.lua` to avoid conflicts

## Verification Results

All plugins tested successfully:
- ✓ lazy.nvim loaded
- ✓ conform (formatting) available
- ✓ lint (linting) available
- ✓ lualine (statusline) available
- ✓ Comment (commenting) available
- ✓ marks (bookmarks) available
- ✓ aerial (code outline) available
- ✓ notify (notifications) available
- ✓ lsp_lines (diagnostic display) available
- ✓ trouble (diagnostic navigation) available
- ✓ Diagnostics properly configured

## No Major Issues Found

The configuration appears to be working correctly. The old plugins (lightline.vim, tcomment_vim, vim-bookmarks) are properly disabled with `enabled = false`.

## Potential Mason Tool Names to Verify

Some tool names in `mason-tool-installer.lua` may need verification:
- `rustfmt` - Usually installed with rust toolchain, not Mason
- `jsonlint` - Might be named differently in Mason registry
- `htmlhint` - Verify exact package name

To check available Mason packages, run `:Mason` in Neovim and search for the tools.

## Recommended Actions

1. Start Neovim and run `:checkhealth` to verify all plugins are healthy
2. Run `:Mason` to ensure all tools are properly installed
3. Test formatting with `\f` on various file types
4. Test linting by editing files with known issues
5. Try the new statusline (lualine) and bookmarks (marks.nvim) features
